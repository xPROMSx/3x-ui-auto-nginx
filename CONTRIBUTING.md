# Contributing to 3x-ui Auto Nginx

## Development

`main` is the maintained production line. Create `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `docs/*` or `chore/*` branches and open pull requests against `main`. Upstream is a reference source; do not automatically synchronize it.

Review product wording with the maintainer in Russian (`README_RU.md`) first, then adapt all seven languages; English is the default GitHub landing page (`README.md`). Preserve exact commands, safety warnings and upstream attribution in every full translation. The maintainer has adopted `GPL-3.0-only` for original xPROMSx developments and changes. Follow the partial scope in `LICENSE` and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`; do not claim permission to relicense inherited material.

## Required checks

All four checks must pass on the current PR revision:

- `Stack XHTTP and security` (`.github/workflows/stack-xhttp.yml`)
- `Stack Backup and restore` (`.github/workflows/stack-backup.yml`)
- `Real services (ubuntu-24.04)` (`.github/workflows/stack-services.yml`)
- `Real services (ubuntu-26.04)` (`.github/workflows/stack-services.yml`)

The jobs have unique names so GitHub can require them separately. The workflows run for pushes to `main`, pull requests targeting `main`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`. They have read-only repository permissions and no repository-secret dependency.

Reproduce the full suites on a disposable Ubuntu 24.04 test environment:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends nginx libnginx-mod-stream certbot sqlite3 openssl curl python3 python3-configobj python3-cryptography tar gzip shellcheck iproute2 apache2-utils
mapfile -d '' -t scripts < <(git ls-files -z -- '*.sh')
for script in "${scripts[@]}"; do bash -n "$script"; done
shellcheck --severity=error "${scripts[@]}"
python3 tests/run_ci.py --check-completeness
NGINX_BIN=/usr/sbin/nginx python3 tests/run_ci.py --suite nonroot
export NGINX_BIN=/usr/sbin/nginx
sudo --preserve-env=NGINX_BIN python3 tests/run_ci.py --suite root
NGINX_BIN=/usr/sbin/nginx python3 tests/run_ci.py --suite integration
NGINX_BIN=/usr/sbin/nginx python3 tests/run_ci.py --suite services
git diff --check
```

The canonical runner collects only TestCase classes defined in each `tests/test_*.py` module, so imported classes run once. Assign every new TestCase to exactly one suite in `tests/run_ci.py`; completeness fails for unassigned classes or stale/duplicate entries. New test methods in an existing class are included automatically. Do not use `unittest discover` as the CI entry point: existing imports would execute tests twice.

The `nonroot`, `integration` and `services` suites require EUID != 0; the `root` suite requires EUID 0 for ownership/permission coverage. Do not run non-root suites under sudo. Legacy entry commands remain available for compatibility but are not the canonical CI interface.

CI checks every tracked shell script with `bash -n` and ShellCheck **error-only**. Existing warning/info/style findings are not suppressed or claimed clean. All tracked workflow YAML is checked with actionlint 1.7.12, downloaded from its official release with a pinned SHA-256 verified before extraction; the workflow records the exact download and checksum.

Every confirmed bug must follow: **reproducing RED regression test → fix → same test PASS → full suite PASS**.

Fast regression (`nonroot`/`root`) uses fixtures, fault injection and negative paths. Real integration uses nginx, pinned/checksummed Xray from 3x-ui v3.9.0, the real private-state x-ui subscription backend and Mihomo. The integration suite downloads verified official binaries automatically; there are no silent missing-binary skips or repository secrets. For offline runs, `INTEGRATION_ARTIFACTS` may point to downloaded `x-ui.tar.gz`, `x-ui.sha256` and `mihomo.gz`; the same hash verification remains mandatory. All listeners and state stay local/temporary, and child processes have bounded cleanup. GitHub jobs have 25-minute deadlines.

Real services (`services`) runs on native `ubuntu-24.04` and `ubuntu-26.04` hosted runners. It verifies pinned official AdGuard Home v0.107.79, loopback DNS, nginx TLS DoH/admin, and Certbot HTTP-01 issuance/renewal against pinned Pebble v2.10.1 with validation enabled and local DNS. No public DNS, Let's Encrypt or secrets are used. Both native jobs also run the pinned official panel’s embedded AmneziaWG TCP/UDP, client export, restart and cryptographic-negative test; no kernel module or external VPN server is installed. `SERVICES_ARTIFACTS` can supply `agh.tar.gz` and `pebble.tar.gz` offline; both pinned hashes are still checked before execution.

The private Backup v3 fixture restores real files and runs the verified AGH binary, DNS/DoH/admin and certificate checks. It uses sudo only for private archived ownership checks; all managed paths are relocated into temporary directories. Systemd, Xray, firewall and other core service management remain controlled fixtures, so this is **PARTIAL Restore integration**, not a full real-system recovery claim. The deploy-hook test uses actual nginx validation/reload and renewed TLS certificates; x-ui restart and systemd state are controlled fixtures.

The repository owner must add the exact checks `Real services (ubuntu-24.04)` and `Real services (ubuntu-26.04)` to branch protection/rulesets for required enforcement. Existing protected check names stay unchanged; this PR does not modify repository settings.

Live VPS acceptance is still required for public DNS, Let's Encrypt, systemd boot, kernel firewall behavior, reboot and full external-network acceptance. Do not run `x-ui-latest.sh` to test syntax: it removes an existing installation. CI does not certify real network/client acceptance. Use a disposable VPS for live checks.

## Verified upstream baseline and Canary

`verified_panel_release()` in `x-ui-latest.sh` is the single version/digest source for production and real integration. The default is 3x-ui v3.9.0 / bundled Xray 26.9.30. Archive pins cover every supported download architecture; functional integration currently covers **amd64 only**. A pinned checksum does not certify architecture-specific runtime behavior.

The installer bootstraps only release-preflight dependencies, then verifies the selected official archive, sidecar and pinned/API digest and validates its layout **before managed cleanup**. Installation consumes that same private archive. Explicit `-version <tag>` requires a published stable release >= v3.8.0 with verifiable assets, and warns when outside the baseline. A manual version choice is not an automatic promotion.

`upstream-canary.yml` runs daily or manually on free Ubuntu 24.04 runners; PRs changing Canary infrastructure also validate it as a non-required check. It runs the existing integration suite with the candidate's own official x-ui and bundled Xray, including native CLI/migration/SQLite persistence, actual RAW/JSON subscriptions, five transport positive/negative pairs and Mihomo. Its report records version, archive SHA-256, bundled Xray and failure diagnostics. It is **not a required PR check**, never writes the baseline, and has no repository-secret or VPS dependency.

A small Actions cache stores only the tested result, keyed by version, digest and test-implementation fingerprint. Unchanged daily candidates reuse the latest tested PASS/FAIL report; preparation/download failures are reported but not cached as tested; changed artifacts/code and every manual run retest. Each fresh result gets a unique cache key, so manual retesting supersedes previous results. Cache eviction causes a fresh run, not a skip. Reports/logs are retained as artifacts for 30 days.

For an explicit local candidate run (non-root, integration dependencies installed):

```bash
python3 tests/upstream_canary.py probe --directory /tmp/xui-canary --version v3.9.0
NGINX_BIN=/usr/sbin/nginx python3 tests/upstream_canary.py run --directory /tmp/xui-canary
python3 tests/upstream_canary.py report --directory /tmp/xui-canary
```

Promote upstream only in a separate reviewed PR: independently confirm all official archive pins, update the single baseline, run all four required jobs, and record full installer/live acceptance. Canary **integration PASS is not full installer acceptance**: systemd lifecycle, public ACME/DNS, kernel UFW, reboot/recovery and non-amd64 behavior still require their own acceptance. Canary failures must be investigated, not hidden by changing assertions or silently substituting baseline binaries.

## Main protection

The main branch protection requires PRs, the required checks and an up-to-date PR branch, with zero required external approvals. Force pushes and deletion are disallowed. Protection applies to administrators; no standing bypass actor is configured.

Emergency recovery is an explicit maintainer action: preserve the current commit, document the incident and exact intended change, and prefer a repair PR. If CI or protection configuration itself blocks recovery, the repository owner may temporarily amend the protection settings, perform the smallest repair, immediately restore the protections, rerun all required checks and record the outcome. This is not permission for routine direct pushes or a permanently exempt automation account.

## Migration compatibility

The initial main checkpoint is `e02bd9e87768afb11b7cad18fc64d77ee637c3b3`, promoted by fast-forward from `personal` after PR #5.

`personal` and historical feature branches/tags/releases are preserved. Do not remove them as part of migration or routine maintenance. Old runtime paths and test identifiers are retained for Backup/Restore compatibility.

## Releases

Publish `vX.Y.Z` project releases from validated `main` with scope, test results and compatibility notes. Preserve historical `personal-v*` releases. Project versioning is separate from the upstream 3x-ui/Xray release versions. Pin the panel with `-version <tag>` when validating a deployment.

User-facing project releases may include a short companion-project footer linking to [Telegram Web Proxy Manager](https://github.com/xPROMSx/3x-ui-auto-nginx#telemt-web-manager); keep it secondary to the actual release changes.
