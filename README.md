**3X-UI AUTO NGINX** installs [3x-ui](https://github.com/MHSanaei/3x-ui) and Xray with nginx, HTTPS, connection profiles, subscriptions, diagnostics, and Backup / Restore. AmneziaWG 3.1 and AdGuard Home with DoH are optional.

Bring two domains and a clean VPS. A cover website is selected and deployed automatically.

## ✨ Why this project

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Preconfigured connections**<br>REALITY, XHTTP, Hysteria2, WebSocket, and Trojan gRPC are already set up. | **Private internal services**<br>The panel and subscription service don't expose their internal ports to the internet. |
| **Restricted nginx routing**<br>Requests cannot be forwarded to arbitrary local ports. | **Backup / Restore v3**<br>Roll back your VPS or restore to a new server, including one from another hosting provider. |
| **Automatic certificates**<br>Let's Encrypt issuance and renewal need no manual configuration. | **AdGuard Home + DoH**<br>Opt in during setup; no third domain needed. |

<a id="installation"></a>

## 🚀 Quick start

Configure the DNS records for **two domains** to point to your VPS IP address: one for the panel, one for REALITY. Connect via SSH as **root** and allow TCP **80/443**, UDP **443**. [Supported systems](#technical-details).

```bash
curl -fSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xPROMSx/3x-ui-auto-nginx/main/x-ui-latest.sh -o x-ui-latest.sh && bash x-ui-latest.sh
```

The installer asks for both domains and offers optional AmneziaWG and AdGuard Home. You can also supply the domains directly:

```bash
bash x-ui-latest.sh -subdomain panel.example.com -reality_domain reality.example.com
```

> **⚠️ Clean install or full reinstall only.** `x-ui-latest.sh` removes the 3x-ui database and nginx configuration. **Do not use it to update a working VPS.** Save a Backup off-server first. A detected installation requires exact uppercase `YES` for reinstall or uninstall.

You receive a **panel URL, random credentials, and diagnostics URL** (3x-ui-authenticated MTR/LibreSpeed). With AdGuard Home: admin URL, password, and DoH endpoint.

## 🚀 Connection profiles

| Connection | Status |
| --- | :---: |
| VLESS + REALITY | ✅ Ready to use |
| VLESS + XHTTP | ✅ Ready to use |
| Hysteria2 | ✅ Ready to use |
| VLESS + WebSocket | ✅ Ready to use |
| Trojan + gRPC | ✅ Ready to use |
| AmneziaWG 3.1 | ✅ Optional |

Five standard profiles are preconfigured; enable the ones you need in 3x-ui without editing nginx. AmneziaWG is added only if selected during installation. **Create clients in the panel**; compatibility depends on your app and version.

### Subscriptions

Standard subscriptions, JSON, and **Mihomo / Clash** use nginx and HTTPS. `provider=1` returns the original subscription for proxy providers instead of a full Clash configuration.

## 🧩 Optional features

Both features can be selected during installation and are disabled by default.

### AdGuard Home + DoH

Enter `y` when prompted `Install AdGuard Home with DNS-over-HTTPS? [y/N]:`. No third domain is needed: the admin UI uses a random `/adg-.../` path on the panel domain, and DoH is available at `https://panel.example.com/dns-query`. Public TCP/UDP port **53** is not opened. Configuration and data are included in **Backup / Restore v3**.

---

### AmneziaWG 3.1

You can configure **AmneziaWG 3.1 on UDP/8443** during installation (disabled by default). Enter `y` when prompted `Install AmneziaWG on UDP port 8443? [y/N]:`. It runs inside 3x-ui and uses the panel domain. After installation, add a client in the 3x-ui panel to get a configuration or `vpn://` link; the installer does not create clients. UFW automatically allows UDP/8443; **Backup / Restore v3** preserves the configuration and restores the rule.

## 💾 Backup / Restore

Backup / Restore **v3** lets you roll back your VPS or recover a compatible server after an OS reinstall. The utility is installed with the server; run as root:

```bash
# Create a new backup
x-ui-backup backup

# List available backups
x-ui-backup list

# Restore a selected backup
x-ui-backup restore /var/backups/x-ui/<archive>.tar.gz
```

Archives are saved in `/var/backups/x-ui/`.

> **Backups contain sensitive data:** the client database, passwords, and certificate private keys. Keep a copy **off the VPS** and restore only trusted archives.

[Recovery on a new VPS](#technical-details).

## 🔐 Security

Service interfaces are not exposed directly to the internet. The panel, subscriptions, and additional services are accessible through nginx and HTTPS, while internal ports remain local.

There is no generic proxy to arbitrary localhost ports. Critical errors stop installation or restore rather than starting an incomplete configuration.

<details>
<summary>⚙️ Technical details and compatibility</summary>

- **Systems:** Ubuntu 24.04, Ubuntu 26.04, and Debian 13. Debian 12 is unsupported.
- **UFW:** adds 80/tcp, 443/tcp, and 443/udp. Inactive UFW is enabled only after the SSH port is detected and allowed; otherwise it remains inactive with a warning. Restore never enables UFW.
- **Certificates:** Let's Encrypt webroot and `certbot.timer` renew certificates automatically without stopping nginx.
- **3x-ui version:** by default, the installer uses the latest version thoroughly tested for compatibility with 3X-UI AUTO NGINX, which may not be the latest upstream release. After installation, you can update 3x-ui using its built-in update mechanism, but the new version may not yet be verified against this configuration. You can also explicitly select another stable release with `-version <tag>` (minimum supported version: v3.8.0); the installer will warn that compatibility has not been verified.

**Recovery on a new VPS:** match the backup's OS, OS version, and architecture. Update DNS if the IP changes. Do not run `x-ui-latest.sh` — install only the utility, then restore a trusted archive:

```bash
curl -fSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xPROMSx/3x-ui-auto-nginx/main/assets/backup/x-ui-backup.sh -o /tmp/x-ui-backup
install -o root -g root -m 0755 /tmp/x-ui-backup /usr/local/bin/x-ui-backup
rm -f /tmp/x-ui-backup
x-ui-backup restore /root/<archive>.tar.gz
```

SSH, OS configuration, and the base firewall remain the administrator's responsibility. For v2 archives, use the utility from the matching older release.

## ✈️ Telegram Web Proxy Manager

[A companion project](https://github.com/xPROMSx/telegram-web-proxy-manager) for your own Telegram WEB Proxy: HTTPS, a cover site, and updates with rollback.

The projects are independent; **this installer does not install Telegram Web Proxy Manager**.

## 🤝 Credits / Origins

Based on [3x-ui-pro](https://github.com/mozaroc/3x-ui-pro), this project is maintained independently. Since the fork, nginx/SNI routing and XHTTP configuration have been substantially reworked, TLS certificate issuance and automatic renewal redesigned, and Backup / Restore v3 introduced with recovery and rollback capabilities. Hysteria2 on UDP/443 was added, and identified security issues were fixed.
